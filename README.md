Noda Time support for RavenDB
=============================

This is a custom extension for RavenDB.  

It allows you to use data types from [Noda Time](http://www.nodatime.org), such as `Instant`, `LocalDateTime`, and others.
Specifically, it enables you to use these types directly in your domain entities, which get serialized into RavenDB documents.

[Full documentation is available here](https://github.com/mj1856/RavenDB-NodaTime/wiki).
